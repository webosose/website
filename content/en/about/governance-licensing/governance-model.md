We encourage participation by anyone who wants to collaborate on the direction of the webOS Open Source Edition (OSE). Hoping for your active involvement, we introduce our community and processes.

## Organization

webOS OSE is an open community, which is governed by the Apache Software License v2.0. The open community is comprised of webOS OSE team members and external contributors. Since the community structure is evolving, in this initial stage, all components will have oversight by the webOS OSE dedicated development team. We hope that public contributors will also actively participate and expand their role as reviewer and maintainer.

## Communication and Process

webOS OSE uses well-known tools and processes to make contributing and communicating straightforward.

These resources include this website, GitHub, and forums. We host code on GitHub, and maintainers use the well-known GitHub pull request mechanism to review and accept contributions. Learn more about [How We Accept Contributions]({{< relref "/contributing#how-we-accept-contributions" >}}).

Everyone contributing to the webOS OSE or participating in the forums or other resources provided by webOS OSE must abide by the [Community Guidelines](https://forum.webosose.org/t/community-guidelines/860). While creative ideas and respectful debates on topics are encouraged, webOS OSE reserves the right to act as needed to protect the integrity of webOS OSE, including the removal of any posts deemed inappropriate or offensive.

Community members should note that the information submitted via the forums or any other communications, resources of the webOS OSE will immediately become public information.
