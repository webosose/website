## zram

From this release onward, webOS OSE supports zram.

**zram** is a BSP module that creates compressed RAM based block devices.

* The zram module creates RAM based block devices named `/dev/zram<id>` (\<id> = 0, 1, ...).
* Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory itself.
* These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides good amounts of memory savings.
* Statistics for individual zram devices are exported through sysfs nodes at `/sys/block/zram<id>/`.
* The `zramctl` command can set up and control zram devices.

For more information, read the kernel guide page: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/blockdev/zram.txt.
