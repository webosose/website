### Known Issues

* Web Inspector and Node Inspector work on Blink-based browsers (Chrome and Opera) but not on non-Blink browsers (Internet Explorer, FireFox, and Safari).

* `ares-server` and `ares-inspect` commands are not terminated on their own, and can only be terminated manually by pressing **Control+C**.

* `ares-package` shows an error message if an app filename contains non-ASCII characters. (App filenames should contain Latin letters ONLY.)

* `ares-setup-device --search|-s` (Search webOS Devices) is not working, because webOS OSE does not contain upnpd.
