You agree that LGE may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK, or any features within the SDK to You or to users generally, at LGE’s sole discretion, without prior notice to You.<br/><br/>2.8	Nothing in this License Agreement gives You any right to use any of LGE’s trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names or other distinctive brand features.<br/><br/>2.9	You agree that You shall not remove, obscure or alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices that may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.<br/><br/>2.10 To the extent that an Application developed by You using the SDK collects and processes the personal and non-personal information of Users, You shall:<br/>(a) Comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to data protection and privacy;<br/>(b) Put in place a privacy policy that informs Users of the types of information that may be collected and the purposes for which this information is collected and processed;<br/>(c) Provide a mechanism for obtaining User consent to the collection and processing of their information in accordance with the User’s privacy policy before the collection of any such information; <br/>(d)	Not collect any information from Users (whether personal or otherwise) unless the appropriate consents have been given;<br/>(e) Only collect, access and use User’s information to the extent necessary for providing the application; <br/>(f) Put in place appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to secure and protect User information; and<br/>(g) Indemnify LGE against any claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to any breach by You of this section 2.10.<br/>2.11	Applications may be rejected if they contain content or materials of any kind(including, but not limited to, text, graphics, images, photographs, sounds, etc.) that LGE reasonably determines to be objectionable or inappropriate, for example, materials that may be considered obscene, pornographic of defamatory.<br/>2.12	You acknowledge and agree that the SDK is not designed, intended, or certified for use in components of systems or Application intended for the operation of weapons, weapons systems, nuclear installations, means of mass transportation, aviation, medical or life-support computers or equipment (including resuscitation equipment and surgical implants), pollution control, hazardous substances management, or for any other dangerous Application in which the failure of the SDK could create a situation where personal injury or death may occur. You understand that use of the SDK in such Applications is fully at Your risk.<br/>2. 13	From time to time during the Term, LGE may provide You with test versions of the SDK.

In such case, this License Agreement shall not affect Your legal relationship with such third party(ies).<br/><br/>4.2	If the Application is distributed, licensed or otherwise offered under the white-labeling of a third party, LGE may object to such distribution if LGE reasonably believes that the distribution of the Application cause adverse effect on LGE’s business and upon such objection, You shall immediately cease to distribute the Application and discuss in good faith to find an alternative which will be beneficial to both Parties. <br/><br/>5.

If You are a California resident, You waive Your rights under California Civil Code §1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” You understand that any fact relating to any matter covered by the foregoing release may be found to be other than now believed to be true and You accept and assume the risk of such possible differences in fact.

Confidentiality.<br/><br/>13.1	You shall not, without the prior written consent of LGE obtained in each instance, disclose any Confidential Information of LGE to any person or entity; provided, however, that any disclosure by You of LGE’s Confidential Information as and to the extent required to comply with judicial or administrative process shall not be deemed a breach of this License Agreement.<br/><br/>14.	Assignment.<br/><br/>14.1	You shall not have the right to assign this License Agreement or any of Your rights hereunder, or to delegate any of Your obligations hereunder, whether in whole or in part; and any assignment or delegation in contravention of this section 14.1 shall be deemed void.

All disputes, controversies and disagreements between the Parties arising out of or related to this License Agreement shall be exclusively submitted for, and finally settled by, arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by three (3) arbitrators exclusively in Seoul, the Republic of Korea, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board. The Parties waive any objection that might be made on the ground that such venue may be in an inconvenient forum. The award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 15.1, in the event You infringe upon or violate the intellectual property rights of LGE or breach any of Your confidentiality obligations hereunder, LGE shall have the right to seek immediate injunctive or other equitable relief (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction.<br/><br/>16.	Miscellaneous.<br/><br/>16.1	This License Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement of the Parties related to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all oral and/or written agreements and understandings between the Parties related to the subject matter hereof. If any provision hereof is held for any reason to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such holding will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof. The failure or delay of LGE to exercise any right under this License Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and shall not prevent LGE from demanding full and exact compliance with this License Agreement. Section headings used in this License Agreement are for the purpose of convenience only and shall not have any legal significance in interpreting the provisions hereof.<br/><br/>Last Updated on: 13 Oct 2014<br/>';
